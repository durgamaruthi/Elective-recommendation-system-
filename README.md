# Elective-recommendation-system-
Students at Presidency University face challenges in selecting their preferred subjects and electives, 
often finding themselves in confusion when their friends are not in the same classes. 
Many students are assigned electives arbitrarily by department heads or the timetable committee to maintain a balanced distribution across disciplines.
To address this issue, a project is proposed where students will develop a system to assist peers in choosing their discipline and open electives by providing recommendations to both students and heads of departments.
